# Project 3
# MyAgenda

'MyAgenda’ is a small project built using Python language. This program will allow the user to add, read, or cancel event and tasks from his Agenda.csv files

# Intention:

Please note this project had been built purely as my Third Project for Code Institute Course. It is simply a display of some of the knowledge I've acquired whilst studying Python module.

## Main goals for this project are: 
-	To provide clear instruction to the user, to let him/her follow the program flow intuitively
-	To create and update a csv file ‘Agenda’

# How It Works

The user will be welcomed by the program and an initial question will be fired to check the user intentions.
Depending on the option selected, the program will let the user:

 1) Open the csv file to display the Agenda to the user, and also display the events in the terminal.
 2) Add a new task in his agenda, and update the file csv only if the user decides to save the event.
 3) Clear a task that no longer the user need/wish to perform on the specific date.

The program will run, until the user decides to shut it down, by selecting the exit option.

# UX

## Strategy:

'MyAgenda’ had been created with the intention of allowing the user to plan his weeks ahead of time and remind him/herself of the events/tasks of the month.

No graphic had been added to this project, following directions of the passing criteria, and to allow deployment through Heroku.

## User Stories:

-	As an user I would like to easily create an event for my agenda
-	Save such event, displayed on the date of its occurrence
-	Receive clear instruction if the command given are not correct

The stories goals above are reached by:
-	Let the user choose the initial task to perform once the program starts
-	Let the user decide if the task written will be saved or not in the agenda file
-	Displaying clear options for the user to choose from, and promptly remind or suggest the right input to select to continue the program
